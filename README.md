## Rewriting a React App in XElement in Astro!

Join [@sarah11918](https://twitter.com/sarah11918) and [@aFuzzyBear](https://twitter.com/aFuzzyBear2) as we slowly but surely recreate sBird as… xBird! Live in the [Astro Discord](https://astro.build/chat)

aFuzzyBear will stream his screen in the Astro Discord live chat channel, and Sarah will open and share a Gitpod Shared Workspace, so everyone who wants to do more than just watch the stream can be live in the code at the same time.
